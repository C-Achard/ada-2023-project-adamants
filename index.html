                <p>This is the story of a regular guy named Bob.<br>
                Bob is playing a little game called <b>Wikispeedia</b></p>
                <div  class="quote">Wikispeedia is an online game where players have to reach a Wikipedia article from another, unrelated Wikipedia article, only by clicking links in the articles encountered.
                    A condensed version of Wikipedia (4,604 articles) is used. Beyond mere entertainment, 
                    Wikispeedia unveils a world where games meet semantics, and unravels the intricate web of connections that bind Wikipedia's articles together.</div>
                <h3>But what makes Bob either good or bad at this game?</h3>
                <p>What strategies does Bob intuitively use to play Wikispeedia successfully? All in all, is Bob a good player?</p>
                <img src="src/strategy.jpg" alt="strategy" style="height: 25%;">
                <p>Answering these questions leads to an exploration of gameplay patterns, through analysing human navigation paths.
                    Analysing player strategies in the Wikispeedia game and assessing correlations with semantic content.
                    Extracting features from player path data will allow for unravelling and analysing of the different strategies used by the players.
                    We have quantitatively described in-game behaviours by newly derived features and assessed how these variables relate to semantic content. 
                    understanding the intricate nuances of interconnected information.</p>

                        <p>
                            This feature informs us on how players navigate through the depths of Wikipedia's articles. Is their path straightforward or more meandering ? 
                            As intuitively expected, it is positively correlated with the rating given by the player and with the time taken to complete the path.

                        <p>
                            This feature allows to investigate whether longer or more difficult paths are correlated with lower ratings and prompt players to abandon the game.
                            It is in fact the case. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This feature informs us how much training the player had before he played the path recorded.
                            It is negatively correlated with the time taken to finish the path recorded, even though ~50% of the IP addresses appear only 1 time (heavily right-skewed distribution). 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Exploring the distribution of average time spent per edge during navigation could also bring some insight.
                            The presence of outliers in this datapoints may give indicators of any trouble the players might have had.

                        <p>
                            This feature integrates several key factors: the average ratio between the user's path and the shortest path to the target article,
                            the proportion of completed versus incomplete paths, and the average time spent on a page. Additionally,
                            it considers the average time taken before a player decides to abandon the path.
                            This feature aims to determine which of these elements are most indicative of a player's skill and effectiveness.

                    <p>
                        This feature could bring insight into whether players scroll to find a word that popped into their heads, or let their search be guided by the options under their sight,
                        that is the first links visible on the article.

                    <p>
                        Thanks to this feature, and using well-known measures such as degree, local clustering, and centrality,
                        we can assess the properties of a given article within the graph. We can then relate these to player paths directly and use them as features for the clustering.
                    </p>

                <li>

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In addition, in an attempt to quantify the strategy of the users, we can look at the degree distribution within a path,
                        take the maximum and fit a line (max. not included) before and after said maximum to one of the graph measures mentioned previously within the path.

                        This lets us see how much a player increases or decreases certain measures along the path;
                        it would for example be expected that a good player would have a sharply positive slope in page degree before the maximum (finding a hub from the start)
                        and then a sharply negative slope once they hone in to their target.

                    <p>
                        This feature could be applied to evaluate path difficulties and compare them to player ratings.
                        What sort of link is there between two related or unrelated articles? Comparison of per-edge and per-path values may give different insights,
                        although per path is likely more relevant.
