                <p>This is the story of a regular guy named Bob.<br>
                Bob is playing a little game called <b>Wikispeedia</b></p>
                <div  class="quote">Wikispeedia is an online game where players have to reach a Wikipedia article from another, unrelated Wikipedia article,
                    only by clicking links in the articles encountered.
                    A condensed version of Wikipedia (4,604 articles) is used. Beyond mere entertainment, Wikispeedia unveils a world where games meet semantics,
                    and unravels the intricate web of connections that bind Wikipedia's articles together.</div>
                <h3>But what makes Bob either good or bad at this game?</h3>
                <p>What strategies does Bob intuitively use to play Wikispeedia successfully? All in all, is Bob a good player?</p>
                <img src="src/strategy.jpg" alt="strategy" style="height: 25%;">
                <p>Answering these questions leads to an exploration of gameplay patterns, through analysing human navigation paths.
                    Analysing player strategies in the Wikispeedia game and assessing correlations with semantic content.
                    Extracting features from player path data will allow for unravelling and analysing of the different strategies used by the players.
                    We have quantitatively described in-game behaviours by newly derived features and assessed how these variables relate to semantic content. 
                    understanding the intricate nuances of interconnected information.</p>

                            It is negatively correlated with the time taken to finish the path recorded, even though ~50% of the IP addresses appear only 1 time (heavily right-skewed distribution).

                    <p>
                        Measure of amount of time, on average, that the player took to travel from one edge to another in the path. It is called "coarse" because it is a global measure, 
                        that does not take into account outlier edges like the median could. This is especially noticeable on paths where the player disconnected, for example.

                    <p>
                        As each page in the path has a closeness centrality associated to it from the full network of Wikipedia,
                        this features is obtained by looking at the derivative of the closeness centrality of each page in the path (that is, the delta between the closeness centrality of a page
                        and the previous one in the path) and summing the absolute value of these deltas before and after the maximal degree page in the path. 
                        This is meant to quantify if the player is strongly looking for a hub page in the path, reaches it (as the maximal degree page is assumed to be a hub page) and then goesto 
                        a specific page from there, i.e. the target page. Indeed, a good player is expected to have a strongly positive delta before the maximal degree page and a strongly
                        negative delta after it. We take the absolute value then sum them to have a single feature that aims at quantifying this behavior.

                    <p>
                        This is a measure of the average similarity between two successive terms in the given path. 
                        The feature is calculated by computing the cosine similarity (normalised dot product) between embeddings (one-hot vectors projected to a lower dimensionality subspace)
                         given by a sentence transformer, which is a model specifically trained in order to give embeddings which have "semantically relevant" / 
                         "semantically informative" relative positions. As such, the cosine similarity gives a measure of logical similarity of the words. 
                         A value of -1 represents opposite meanings / topics, around 0 means unrelated, and around 1 means highly similar meanings / topics. 
                         The mean of this is supposed to approximately capture how related topics globally were on a given path.
