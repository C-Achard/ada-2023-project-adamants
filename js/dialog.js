    "In this game, we navigate from one Wikipedia article to a target article, seemingly unrelated, using only the hyperlinks as our pathways.",
    "It's like a digital maze, a condensed version of Wikipedia with over four thousand articles, each a unique playground for the mind.",
    "You see, my adventures in Wikispeedia are more than just a way to pass time. They're a quest â€“ a quest to uncover the hidden pathways of knowledge, to delve deep into the interconnected web of information.",
    // "Each journey I undertake is a discovery, a revelation of the vast diversity that Wikipedia holds.",

    // "So, join me on this journey. Let's unravel the mysteries of Wikispeedia together.",

    // Last night your mother had a dream...
    // We know that some futures are not cast, by writer or Maker, but the dream tells that D'ni will grow again someday. New seekers of D'ni will flow in from the desert feeling called to something they do not understand.
    // But the dream also tells of a desert bird with the power to weave this new D'ni's future. We fear such power - it changes people.
    // Yeesha, our desert bird, your search seems to take you further and further from us. I hope what you find will bring you closer.
